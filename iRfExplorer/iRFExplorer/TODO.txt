Questions:

We have hardcoded the min frequency span setting to 112kHz (found on a WSUB1G)
    Any way to learn this ?

When the device is in a menu mode as opposed to graph display mode - there is no output/response from the serial port. 
    So can we reliably detect/change mode ?

Current_Config

    Seems the frequency fields in setConfig are %07d and the dBms are %03d
        is that mandatory ?

    It says size==30 bytes == but cmd string excluding #<len> is exactly 30 - so that makes <size> 32. 

    It says Freq_Step in the spec - but the code seems to use nEndKhz in UpdateRemoteConfigData()

Spectrum
    is the band from minFreq to minFreq-Span -- or is it centered around minFreq

Numbers of samples in Spectrum
    We look at the byte just after $S. What is a sensible/acceptable range ?

Hardcoding of dBm range of -001 (max) to -120 (min) with 10dBm separation.
    Can we learn this somehow ?
    Is it the same for all devices ?

On OSX
    Is the driver always called 'SLAB' ? So we can auto select that one if found and no prefs.
