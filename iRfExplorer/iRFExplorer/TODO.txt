PROTOCOL WISHES
-   Learn min dBm step and freq. span's ranges on the
    wire rather than hardcode. Extra #C reply perhaps.
    (Verions 1.02 will ignore unkn #..\r\n cleanly.)
-   Send a command to the device to 'force' it into scan/measure more
    when it is in a config menu.
-   Special commend to set the device in remote measure mode
    during which the screen goes blank/unlit and/or keys get blocked.
-   discover RBW from a C#
